# search-endpoint

To run this script, you need to populate your Pinecone database, provide your `index_name` in the script, and run the `embedding-endpoint` Docker first. Then, you can run the `search.py` script to get a first look at what the script does. Additionally, you can run the search_with_flask.py` script to launch the Flask app and test the endpoint using Postman or curl.

Furthermore, a Dockerfile is provided to help you build the Docker image and run it on your local machine.
